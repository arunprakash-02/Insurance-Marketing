- What is the business problem that your project is trying to solve?

The business problem addressed by this dataset revolves around understanding and improving customer retention and policy renewals in the insurance industry. Key questions and issues include:

Customer Retention and Lifetime Value:

Objective: To identify patterns and factors that influence customer retention and lifetime value.
Analysis: By analyzing Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV), the company can identify high-value customers and tailor their renewal strategies accordingly.
Renewal Rates by Demographics and Channels:

Objective: To determine how different customer demographics and sales channels impact policy renewals.
Analysis: Understanding the renewal rates across different customer segments (e.g., age, gender, marital status) and sales channels (e.g., agents, call centers) can help in designing targeted renewal campaigns.
Reasons for Non-Renewal:

Objective: To identify the most common reasons why customers choose not to renew their policies.
Analysis: By examining the reasons for non-renewal, the company can address specific pain points and improve customer satisfaction and retention rates.
Correlation Between Claims and Renewals:

Objective: To explore the relationship between the total claim amounts and the likelihood of policy renewal.
Analysis: This can help in understanding if high claim amounts deter renewals and if so, devise strategies to mitigate this effect.
Effectiveness of Renewal Offers:

Objective: To assess the effectiveness of different types of renewal offers.
Analysis: Analyzing which renewal offers lead to higher renewal rates can help in optimizing offer strategies.
